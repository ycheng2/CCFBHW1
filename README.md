# Building
The project uses Gradle as the build tool.  You can read more about Gradle here -

To build the application, run the following Gradle command -

    gradlew build

The build command will create an executable JAR file that will be found in "application/build/libs".

# Running the Application Locally
You can execute the JAR file using the following command

    java -jar ./build/libs/image-gallery-0.1.0.jar

The application should be running at http://localhost:8080/

There are some images in the "application/test-images" folder that you can use to verify your setup.
